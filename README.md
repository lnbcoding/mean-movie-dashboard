# mean-movie-dashboard

Trying learn the MEAN stack by building a single page movie search app.

URL: https://mean-movie-search.herokuapp.com/movies

NOTICE: May have to allow the script to run for the app to run. Looking for ways to fix this

This app will use open source movie db APIs to search for movies
- You have to search by Movie Title and the Year to get the info
- The search results will display various Movie Info:
- Title, Year, Rated, Plot, Awards, IMDB Rating and # of Votes, etc...

**Release 1.0**
- MVP-Heroku-Ruby is the branch that is deployed to Heroku

- User can search for any movie

- Deploy to Heroku

**Future Release**
- Add a top 15 most popular movies
